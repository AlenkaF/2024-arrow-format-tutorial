    "# Extension Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arrow columnar format allows defining extension types or user-defined types to enable extending standard Arrow data types with custom semantics specific to the system or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Universally unique identifier (`uuid`) can be represented as a `FixedSizeBinary` type\n",
    "* Trading time can be represented as a `Timestamp` with metadata indicating the market trading calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension types can be defined by annotating any of the built-in Arrow logical types (the “storage type”) with a **custom type name** and **optional serialized representation** (`'ARROW:extension:name'` and `'ARROW:extension:metadata'` keys in the `Field` metadata structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Columnar.html#extension-types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Canonical Extension Types\n",
    "\n",
    "It is beneficial to share the definitions of well-known extension types so as to improve interoperability between different systems integrating Arrow columnar data. For this reason canonical extension types are defined in Arrow itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fixed and variable shape tensor\n",
    "  - https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#fixed-shape-tensor\n",
    "  - https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#variable-shape-tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CanonicalExtensions.html#\n",
    "\n",
    "## Community Extension Types\n",
    "\n",
    "These are Arrow extension types that have been established as standards within specific domain areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GeoArrow : collection of Arrow extension types for representing vector geometries\n",
    "  - https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  PointArray:PointType(geoarrow.point)[3]\n",
    "  <POINT (1 3)>\n",
    "  <POINT (2 4)>\n",
    "  <POINT (3 5)>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subclassing ExtensionType from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining extension types from Python is done by subclassing pyarrow [`ExtensionType`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/generated/pyarrow.ExtensionType.html#pyarrow.ExtensionType) and giving the derived class its own extension name and serialization mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "UUID example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class UuidType(pa.ExtensionType):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__(pa.binary(16), \"my_package.uuid\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __arrow_ext_serialize__(self):\n",
    "        return b''\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def __arrow_ext_deserialize__(cls, storage_type, serialized):\n",
    "        assert storage_type == pa.binary(16)\n",
    "        assert serialized == b''\n",
    "        return UuidType()\n",
    "```"
