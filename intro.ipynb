    "# Apache Arrow\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Arrow was born with the idea to define a set of standards for data representation and interchange between languages and systems to avoid costs of data serialization/deserialization and in order to avoid reinventing the wheel on each of those systems and languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each system / language requires their own format definitions, implementation of common algorithms, etcetera. In our heterogeneous environments we often have to move data from one system/language to accommodate our workflows that meant copy&convert the data between them, which is quite costly.\n",

    "\n",
    "![image info](./diagrams/with_arrow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the initial vision, Arrow has grown to also develop a multi-language collection of libraries for solving systems problems related to in-memory analytical data processing. This includes such topics as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-copy shared memory and RPC-based data movement\n",
    "- Reading and writing file formats (like CSV, Apache ORC, and Apache Parquet)\n",
    "- In-memory analytics and query processing\n",

The library is in active development.\n",
